### Lesson Learned - Clean Code By Robert Cecil Martin
- Make no harm to the function. It is professional developers responsibility to not harm or alter the existing code functions. They should code in a way that QA could not found any bug not the other way around.
- Make no harm to the structure. Because of poor code structuring, tasks used to take days begins to take weeks, then months management add more developers to boost the productivity of the code but instead new developers ends up in damaging existing structure more raising the impediment
- Merciless Refactoring - Always checkout codebase in better shape than you first checkin.
- List of things every every professional developer should know about
    - <b> Design Patters</b>: All patterns from Gang of Four Book and Pattern Oriented Software Architecture.
    - <b> Design Principle </b>: SOLID and component.
    - <b> Methods </b>: XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis, and Structured Design.
    - <b> Disciplines </b>: TDD, Object-Oriented design, Structured Programming, Continuous Integration, and Pair Programming.
    - <b> Artifacts </b>: UML, DFDs, Structure Charts, Petri Nets, State Transition Diagrams and Tables, flow charts, and decision tables.
- Worst code you can write is at 3:00am. Don't write code when you are tired.
- It should be the goal of the development group that QA find nothing wrong.
- Nothing has a more profound or long-lasting negative effect on the productivity of a software team than a mess.
